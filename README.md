# Job Matcher Project
Job hunting can be exhausting, especially when it involves sifting through countless listings and submitting endless applications. The idea for this project came from my own experience applying for data science roles, where I noticed that identical job titles often entail vastly different responsibilities depending on the company or industry. This makes it challenging and time-consuming to find positions that genuinely align with one’s skills and interests. Job Matcher aims to solve this by recommending the most relevant jobs based on a user’s resume or job description, helping streamline the application process and focus on opportunities that truly fit.
